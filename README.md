# American Sign Language Alphabet Dataset and Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. It utilizes the [American Sign Language Alphabet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashishsau/aslamerican-sign-language-aplhabet-dataset) hosted on Kaggle, and includes a Jupyter Notebook implementing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises images of ASL alphabets from A-Z. Each image corresponds to a unique letter in the alphabet, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks like image classification. The dataset is available at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashishsau/aslamerican-sign-language-aplhabet-dataset).

### Dataset Highlights:
- Contains a large collection of labeled images.
- Preprocessed for easy training and validation.

## Repository Contents

- **`asl_mlp_modified_notebook_final_version.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the MLP model, preprocessing steps, and evaluation results.
- Instructions and code for loading, preprocessing, and visualizing the dataset.
- Steps for training the model and evaluating its performance.
